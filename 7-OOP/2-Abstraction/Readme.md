# Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming

Abstraction is one of the key principles in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and only exposing the necessary functionalities to the outside world. Abstraction allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. It simplifies the programming model by providing a clear separation between interface and implementation.

## Abstraction in Python

In Python, abstraction can be achieved through the use of classes and methods. By defining classes with methods that represent the behaviors of objects, we can abstract away the implementation details from the users of those objects.
