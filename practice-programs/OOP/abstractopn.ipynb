    "# Abstraction in Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** is one of the fundamental concepts in programming and design, especially in object-oriented programming. It involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential attributes and behaviors. Abstraction allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, hiding the unnecessary details of the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is often achieved through abstract classes and methods, which provide a blueprint for derived classes to implement. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated themselves, but they define a common interface for their subclasses.\n"
