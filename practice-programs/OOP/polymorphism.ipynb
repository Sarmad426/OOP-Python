    "# Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same method or operation to be performed in different ways depending on the specific object type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world example:\n",
    "Consider a real-world scenario of a music player application. The application has a `play` method that can be invoked on different types of audio files, such as MP3, WAV, and FLAC. Each audio file type has its own implementation of the `play` method, but the application can treat all these audio files as a common type (e.g., `AudioFile`) and call the `play` method without knowing the specific file type.\n",
