    "### Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance refers to the ability of a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. In other words, a subclass can inherit from multiple superclasses. This means that the subclass has access to all the methods and attributes of each of its parent classes. However, multiple inheritance can lead to complex class hierarchies and potential issues such as the diamond problem, where the same method is inherited from two different parent classes. Python supports multiple inheritance, but it requires careful design to avoid such issues."

    "#### Multi-level Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-level inheritance, refers to a situation where a class inherits from another class, and then another class inherits from this derived class. This creates a hierarchical relationship between classes, where each subsequent class adds more specific attributes or behavior to the hierarchy. It is a simpler form of inheritance compared to multiple inheritance, as there is only one direct parent class for each subclass. This hierarchy can be seen as a chain of classes, with each link representing a level of inheritance. Multi-level inheritance is commonly used to model real-world relationships where subclasses specialize or refine the behavior of their parent classes."
